# MANGLEE

## Project Description 
:deciduous_tree:This is a tool created within the Google Earth Engine platform that integrates cloud computing, remote sensing and machine learning, it will be free and educational and will allow continuous monitoring of changes in the mangrove ecosystem of Ecuador.
The tool applies supervised classification algorithms (Random Forest) and is fed by optical and radar data from the Copernicus project.

## Tools 
:artificial_satellite:
To detect changes, the process was divided into three algorithms, the first 
1. Construction of the temporary compound M1
2. M2 sorting algorithm
3. M3 Change Detection Tool
